	What I want to eventually achieve with this game
	is a rough clone of the game drug wars.
	
	The aim of drugwars is to make as much money as 
	you can over a 30 day period. You start off with
	a loan, which if not payed back, grows larger each
	day, due to interest. The player travels to 
	different countries to buy and sell their goods.
	Each trip is a day, and prices/good fluctuate 
	between countries. The player can bank their money
	and withdraw it for buys. There are random events
	such as police interrupting deals, customs inter-
	vening and such. 

	So my aim is to do a non-drug related version.
	I'll start with getting the player and the shops
	working, then I'll move onto the game logic, the
	random events, the fluctuating prices, the loan-	
	shark, the banking system.

	This started as a simple exercise in lists, hope I 
	haven't bitten off more than I can chew.
